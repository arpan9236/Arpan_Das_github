In the 'Python_ML_DL_DS' folder, I have writeen lot of Python codes, starting from basics to some very interesting problems of a standard Data Science course. 
I have mainly solved the problems or assignments given in the course "Foundations of Data Science" introduced by "One Fourth Labs". I have written codes of basic 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sympy, and I have used matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization of the plots.
