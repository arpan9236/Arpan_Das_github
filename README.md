Here, I have writeen a lot of Python codes, starting from basics to some very interesting problems of a standard Data Science course. 
I have mainly solved the problems or assignments given in the course "Foundations of Data Science" introduced by "One Fourth Labs". I have written codes of basic 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sympy, descriptive statistics, sample spaces and events, random variables, distribution of sample statistics, central limit theorem, chi-square distribution, point and interval estimators, and hypothesis testing. I have used matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization of the plots. I have written codes on various numerical methods 
using Python. There is one code on solving tight binding Hamiltonian matrix using SymPy. There are other codes also for solving very interesting problems. 

As I am trained and have more than 6 years of experience in materials modelling and computer simulations of materials (Computation is the 3rd paradigm of Science after 1st: Experiment and 2nd: Theory), and now I am learning data science and machine learning, my bigger aim is to combine the 4th paradigm of Science i.e, data-driven approach (using machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence) with the 3rd paradigm Computation (which generates a lot of data) in rational design of materials with selected properties.
