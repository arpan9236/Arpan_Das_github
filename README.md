In the 'Python_ML_DL_DS' folder, I have writeen a lot of Python codes, starting from basics to some very interesting problems of a standard Data Science course. 
I have mainly solved the problems or assignments given in the course "Foundations of Data Science" introduced by "One Fourth Labs". I have written codes of basic 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sympy, and I have used matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization of the plots. I have written codes on various numerical methods 
using Python. There is also one code on solving tight binding Hamiltonian matrix using SymPy. 

In 'Udemy_Machine_LearningA-Z' folder, I have build and trained various Machine Learning (ML) models which I have learnt from Udemy ML course 
(Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]). I have written codes on data preprocessing and various regression models like 
simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. 
I have also compared these models and shown how to choose the best regression model. I have completed the course upto this portion. Currently I am learning 
the other ML topics and models. I will update the codes for other ML models as I finish learning topics. 

In "Numerical_Methods_QM_P-Giannozzi" folder, I have written python codes for numerical methods in Quantum Mechanics which is taught by 
Paolo Giannozzi (Developer of Quantum ESPRESSO code and Professor at University of Udine, Italy) and noted in a book/pdf given in his website. 
My vision is to understand the numerical methods, apply in quantum mechanical and solid state physics problems and write all the codes in python. 
I have started working on it. Many more to come. Finally, I will apply all the methods and write the codes of density functional theory (DFT) using python. 

As I am trained in materials modelling and computer simulations of materials, and now I am learning data science and machine learning, my bigger aim is to apply machine learning,
 data science and artificial intelligence in materials simulations for rational design of nanomaterials.
