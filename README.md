In the 'Python_ML_DL_DS' folder, I have writeen a lot of Python codes, starting from basics to some very interesting problems of a standard Data Science course. 
I have mainly solved the problems or assignments given in the course "Foundations of Data Science" introduced by "One Fourth Labs". I have written codes of basic 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sympy, and I have used matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization of the plots. I have written codes on various numerical methods 
using Python. 

In 'Udemy_Machine_LearningA-Z' folder, I have build and trained Machine Learning (ML) models which I have learnt from Udemy ML course. I have written codes on 
data preprocessing and various regression models like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial linear regression, support vector regression, 
decision tree regression, and random forest regression. I have also compared these models and shown how to choose the best regression model. I have completed 
the course upto this portion. Currently I am learning the other ML topics and models. I will update the codes for other ML models as I finish learning topics. 

In "Numerical_Methods_QM_P-Giannozzi" folder, I have written code for numerical methods in Quantum Mechanics which is taught by Paolo Giannozzi (Developer of Quantum ESPRESSO 
code and Professor at University of Udine, Italy) and noted in a book/pdf. My vision is to understand the numerical methods, apply in quantum mechanical and solid state physics
problems and write all the codes in python. I have started working on it. Many more to come. Finally, I will apply all the methods and write the codes of density functional theory 
using python.
